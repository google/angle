### Notes [1]
* Images in non-compute shaders are not implemented yet.
* Multiple image variables are not allowed to be bound to the same image unit which refers to the same layer and level of a texture image. It means image aliasing is not supported.
* The same layer and level of a texture are not allowed to be bound to multiple image units.
* When a texture is bound to an image unit, the image unit format must exactly match the texture internal format. Similarly, the format layout qualifier for an image variable must exactly match the format of the image unit. Re-interpretation is not supported. See [sss616](http://anglebug.com/3038).

### Notes [2]
* Shader storage blocks in non-compute shaders are not implemented yet.
* Multiple shader storage blocks are not allowed to be bound to the same buffer. See [7524](http://anglebug.com/3032).
